# 📊 Student Performance Factors

## 📄 Project Description
This project explores the relationship between various factors and student performance using data analysis techniques. We examine how different variables, such as study hours, teacher quality, and school type, correlate with exam scores. The project uses visualizations like box plots, histograms, and heatmaps to present findings.

The goal is to gain insights into the elements that influence student outcomes and to better understand the role of these factors in academic success.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Student performance factors.ipynb`).
2. Ensure your environment has the necessary dependencies (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
3. Run all cells in the notebook to execute the data analysis and visualize the results.

## 📊 Analysis
The notebook includes:
- 📈 **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, cleaning, and formatting the dataset.
- 📉 **Visualizations**: 
    - **Boxplots**: To compare student exam scores across various categories like school type or teacher quality.
    - **Histograms**: To show the distribution of exam scores and other continuous variables.
    - **Heatmaps**: To display correlations between different numerical variables.
    - **Violin Plots**: To show the distribution of scores across different groups.
- 📊 **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation matrices to identify significant relationships between variables such as study hours and exam performance.

## 📁 Key Files
- `Student performance factors.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and visualizations.
- `data.csv` (or the equivalent dataset): The data file used for analysis (ensure the dataset is available in the same directory as the notebook).

## 🔍 Insights
This project reveals:
- 🎓 **Study Hours**: There is a significant positive correlation between hours studied and exam performance.
- 🏫 **Teacher Quality**: Teacher quality appears to influence exam outcomes, with higher-quality teachers linked to better student performance.
- 🏢 **School Type**: Public and private school students show differing trends in exam scores.
- 📊 **Correlations**: The heatmap highlights key correlations between variables like study hours, teacher quality, and exam results.

## 👩‍💻 Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and processing.
- **Pandas**: To manage and manipulate datasets.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations such as bar charts, box plots, and heatmaps.
